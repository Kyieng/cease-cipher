# ABOUT/History
The Caesar Cipher was named after Julius Caesar (100 B.C. â€“ 44 B.C). He would use the cipher for secret communication (protect messages of military significance). The Caesar Cipher is a substitution cipher. Originally, Julius Caesar would use a shift of three to encrypt/decrypt a message. The Caesar Cipher encrypts a message using an affine function : f(x) = 1x + b.
